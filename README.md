# Nick Chat

This is a complete chat app, where the user can create private and group conversations.<br>
Inside the chats, the user can send texts, images or emogis.

# How it was made:

## Front-end

For the front-end, I used the famous library **React**, with **SASS** and **typescript**.<br>
This was my first "Big" project using React, so I was still a little confused when working with components.

## Back-end

For the back-end, I used a bunch of **firebase** products, such as:<br>
- User Authentication;
- Firestore;
- Realtime database (Which I ended up changing to Firestore);
- Storage;
- Hosting;

# Conclusion

This was My first nice project using React and Firebase, so I could learn a lot during the development process.<br>
After A LOT of mistakes, I could realize that, even thought firebase is VERY easy to use and configure, it is much better to have your own back-end, so you can have more control of the data in your app.<br>
This way, after this project, I decided to learn Node.js, that is a technology I always found interesting and useful.
